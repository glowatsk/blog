<p>I found myself looking at updating my personal website, as it had become quite outdated. 
Long ago, I had made a site to learn vue as I was working with full time full stack development at the time.
Since I much prefer not to play with Javascript, I had started looking for alternatives.</p>
<p>You can take a look at <a href="https://jamstack.org/generators/">Jamstack</a> to see the major players in the space.
However, <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> had been the pitch that I needed to give it a try.
I had worked with Go at my previous job and had enjoyed it, I knew I wanted to write my content in markdown syntax, as I have done for both my notes and resume.</p>
<h2 id="why-zola">Why Zola?</h2>
<p>I have also been recently bitten by the Rust bug. I have been working my way through <a href="https://www.zero2prod.com/">zero to production rust</a> and
at work we had recently replaced our flake8 linter with <a href="https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff">Ruff</a>. I was first introduced
to Zola through <a href="https://blog.adamchalmers.com/">Adam Chalmers Blog</a>. I followed through basic site generation with Hugo and Zola
and Zola, both were incredibly pain free.</p>
<p>Being that Zola's templating was styled around Jinja2 (which I was most familiar with) and my current infatuation with rust.
I felt there was no reason not send it and see how it performs. Which is great with static site generators, as the markdown content
is easily transferable.</p>
