# Motivation
I found myself looking at updating my personal website, as it had become quite outdated. 
Long ago, I had made a site to learn react as I was working with full time full stack development at the time.
Since I much prefer not to play with Javascript, I had started looking for alternatives.

You can take a look at [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/generators/) to see the major players in the space.
However, [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) had been the pitch that I needed to give it a try.
I had worked with Go at my previous job and had enjoyed it, I knew I wanted to write my content in markdown syntax, as I have done for both my notes and resume.

## Why Zola?
I have also been recently bitten by the Rust bug. I have been working my way through [zero to production rust](https://www.zero2prod.com/) and
at work we had recently replaced our flake8 linter with [Ruff](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff). I was first introduced
to Zola through [Adam Chalmers Blog](https://blog.adamchalmers.com/). I followed through basic site generation with Hugo and Zola
and Zola, both were incredibly pain free.

Being that Zola's templating was styled around Jinja2 (which I was most familiar with) and my current infatuation with rust.
I felt there was no reason not send it and see how it performs. Which is great with static site generators, as the markdown content
is easily transferable.
