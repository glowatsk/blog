I am a backend developer for [Muckrack](www.muckrack.com) working on the Content team. Building, processing, managing our attempt to download all the articles on the internet. 
Tools I use every day include Python, Celery, RabbitMQ, Redis, Prometheus / Grafana, Kafka and Dagster.

I am based in Edmonton, Alberta with my beautiful wife and comically cute cat.

In my spare time my primary hobbies involve cooking, coffee, working on my homelab.

Talk to me about music, computers, coffee, cooking, powerlifting, self hosting, and of course, programming.
